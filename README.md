## About Me

I'm a builder of digital experiencesâ€”crafting sleek web and mobile apps using tools like React, TypeScript, and React Native. Iâ€™m fueled by curiosity and a love for learning, always diving into new technologies and turning ideas into interactive, meaningful products. For me, coding is more than a skillâ€”itâ€™s a playground where I learn by building, break things to understand them, and take on challenges that sharpen my edge.

From the beginning of my journey, I always tried to work in a stack-boundary-less way. And still, I am trying to learn new technologies and implement them.
